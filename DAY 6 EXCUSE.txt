Subject: Apologies for Missing Day 6 

Dear [Sir Ameen],

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to sincerely apologize for not being able to complete the tasks for Day 6 on time. Unfortunately, I was suffering from a high fever and was unable to focus or work effectively.

InshaAllah, I will ensure to complete everything by tomorrow without fail. Thank you for your understanding and patience.

Best regards,
[Abdullah]
